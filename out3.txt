In the console, type clear and hit Enter or Return. 

This will clear the console output. 

Run the file once while the tasks are longer. 

Copy and paste the terminal results (when task_duration is 3) here.

Now - increase the task duration (representing 
      the time the task has the database 
      tied up during an insert statement).
How well do multiple, concurrent processes share a database 
    when each task takes more time? 
How can multiple processes share a resource
    without interfering with each other?
